# Chat & Live Interface

## Description

Implement a chat interface that allows players to communicate either with the dealer and other players or with live support.

- A toggle/switch should be available on the left side of the chat interface to switch between the Game Chat (with the dealer and other players) and Live Support.

- By default, the chat with players and dealers should be open.

### Chat Rules

- Maximum message length: 75 characters.

- Display the last 50 messages in the chat.

- Players can see messages sent by other players in the Game Chat.

- When the chat window is opened, players must be able to switch between the Game Chat with the dealer and Live Support.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Players can send messages in the Game Chat visible to the dealer and other players.

- Players can switch to Live Support chat within the same interface.

- Players can send messages to Live Support, but these messages are only visible to the player and Live Support, not to other players.

- The chat should display the last 50 messages sent by players and dealers in the Game Chat.
